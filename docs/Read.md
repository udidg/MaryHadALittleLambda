MaryHadALittleLambda
====================

MaryHadALittleLambda is a simple project using the very finest retro 8-bit graphics to demonstrate some of Java 8 new APIs.
When running the application you'll meet Mary, a nice retro farmer walking in her villege.

Mary can visit several places:
1. The Barn - When Mary visits the Barn she'll release 7 Lambs that will follow her.
2. The Rainbow - When Mary steps on the rainbow, all the lambs get colored
3. Church - The Churchs takes all the white (pure) Lamb.
4. Chicken Coop - When Mary steps on the chicken coop, all the lambs turns into a chicken eggs.
5. Nest - When Mary steps on the nest, all the eggs turns into chickens!



Step 1:
After playing for a min, you imidietaly notice that Mary can exit the screen.
Revise the code and prevent Mary from stepping out of the screen.


Step 2:
Edit the code so that the minute Mary step in the Chicken Coop, a Fox will suddenly appear behind the last Lamb.
The Fox will chase the Lambs.

Step 3:
Edit the code so that in case the Fox catch a Lamb (they both step in the same tile), the fox eats the Lamb and becomes Chubby.
If the Fox eats another Lamb it becomes even Fatter!
