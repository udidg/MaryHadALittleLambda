MaryHadALittleLambda is a simple project using the very finest retro 8-bit graphics to demonstrate some of Java 8 new APIs.
When running the application you'll meet Mary, a nice retro farmer walking in her village.

Mary can visit several places:
1. The Barn - When Mary visits the Barn she'll release 7 Lambs that will follow her.
2. The Rainbow - When Mary steps on the rainbow, all the lambs get colored
3. Church - The Church takes all the white (pure) Lamb.
4. Chicken Coop - When Mary steps on the chicken coop, all the lambs turns into a chicken eggs.
5. Nest - When Mary steps on the nest, all the eggs turns into chickens!

### <i class="icon-file"></i> Exercise
-------------

##### Step I

- Clone the project and run.
- After playing for a min, you immediately notice that Mary can exit the screen ðŸ˜¯.
- Revise the code and prevent Mary from stepping out of the screen.

##### Step II
Remove the Fox element from the screen.

##### Step III
Edit the code so that the minute Mary steps in the Chicken Coop, a Fox will suddenly appear behind the last Lamb.
The Fox will chase the Lambs.

##### Step IIII
Edit the code so that in case the Fox catches a Lamb (they both step on the same tile), the fox eats the Lamb and becomes chubby.
If the Fox eats another Lamb it becomes even Fatter!
